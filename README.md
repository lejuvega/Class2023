# Class2023

This book is the result of documents created for my Big Data Analytics class in 2023.

In this repository, you will find useful documents to learn all kinds of data manipulation. You will learn to use different R and Python libraries and the most basic commands of both languages. Additionally, I have included cheat sheets from various libraries in both languages.

We will cover SQL and NoSQL data analysis and explore packages such as Tidyverse and Pandas for data selection and modification. We will also learn visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and ggplot to present data. Finally, we will use packages for social network analysis and text analysis to extract information from some documents and learn how to understand text.
